# ForgeFoil - Airfoil Optimization Platform

## Overview
ForgeFoil is a modern web application designed for aerodynamic engineers and researchers to analyze, optimize, and compare airfoil profiles. The platform provides an intuitive interface for visualizing airfoil geometries and their aerodynamic performance characteristics.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Airfoil Visualization**: Real-time rendering of airfoil profiles with detailed coordinate visualization
- **Performance Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of key aerodynamic parameters:
  - Lift Coefficient (Cl)
  - Drag Coefficient (Cd)
  - Moment Coefficient (Cm)
  - Lift-to-Drag Ratio (L/D)
- **Optimization Tools**: Advanced optimization capabilities to improve airfoil performance
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of optimization progress with detailed metrics
- **Modern UI**: Clean and responsive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- UI Components: Custom components with Tailwind CSS
- Visualization: SVG-based rendering for precise airfoil geometry display
- State Management: React hooks for efficient data handling
